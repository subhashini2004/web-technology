At RV University, we strive to provide students with a holistic outlook on business administration discipline. We like to keep them abreast with the pertinent events so as to prepare them for the future. We encourage students to be curious and courageous to question the existing practices. We equip them with skill-sets to help them deconstruct the existing policies, practices and reframe them for the current needs. RV university believes that change is the only constant and that one needs to at least keep pace with it. We do not limit our curriculum to the conventional courses seen across established institutes. Instead, we endeavour to expose students to contemporary issues such that they can be the harbinger of change that the industry desires. Our curriculum is designed so as to inculcate knowledge through practice and collaboration with industry and academic experts. We at RV university take due cognizance of a student’s individuality and wish to aid them in their career growth.

The curriculum is built to provide a comprehensive understanding of the four pillars of Business Administration: Finance, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and Business Analytics. Each of these pillars is offered to students to opt from as their major. However, in the spirit of providing freedom to the students, we do not limit a student to courses that they wish to major in. Additionally, we expose students to academic writings, digital literacy, and debates, which do not fall in the scheme of things in most of the schools across the nation.

The whole duration of the program is divided into three major parts. The first year is devoted to building a liberal foundation of the students which holds the student in good stead for the future irrespective of the major or area that she/he opts for. The first half of the second year is devoted to the core of general management principles, which entails managerial economics, managerial accounting, operations management, and organizational behaviour. The rest of the duration of the program is devoted to the core topics of the specialization that a student wishes to major in. The last semester of the curriculum enables the students to go in-depth about the career track they wish to take up.<br><br>
